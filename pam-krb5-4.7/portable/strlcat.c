/*
 * Replacement for a missing strlcat.
 *
 * Provides the same functionality as the *BSD function strlcat, originally
 * developed by Todd Miller and Theo de Raadt.  strlcat works similarly to
 * strncat, except simpler.  The result is always nul-terminated even if the
 * source string is longer than the space remaining in the destination string,
 * and the total space required is returned.  The third argument is the total
 * space available in the destination buffer, not just the amount of space
 * remaining.
 *
 * The canonical version of this file is maintained in the rra-c-util package,
 * which can be found at <http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/rra-c-util/>.

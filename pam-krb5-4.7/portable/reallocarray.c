/*
 * Replacement for a missing reallocarray.
 *
 * Provides the same functionality as the OpenBSD library function
 * reallocarray for those systems that don't have it.  This function is the
 * same as realloc, but takes the size arguments in the same form as calloc
 * and checks for overflow so that the caller doesn't need to.
 *
 * The canonical version of this file is maintained in the rra-c-util package,
 * which can be found at <http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/rra-c-util/>.

/*
 * Replacement for a missing strlcpy.
 *
 * Provides the same functionality as the *BSD function strlcpy, originally
 * developed by Todd Miller and Theo de Raadt.  strlcpy works similarly to
 * strncpy, except saner and simpler.  The result is always nul-terminated
 * even if the source string is longer than the destination string, and the
 * total space required is returned.  The destination string is not nul-filled
 * like strncpy does, just nul-terminated.
 *
 * The canonical version of this file is maintained in the rra-c-util package,
 * which can be found at <http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/rra-c-util/>.

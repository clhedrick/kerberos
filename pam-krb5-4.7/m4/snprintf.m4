dnl Test for a working C99 snprintf.
dnl
dnl Check for a working snprintf.  Some systems have an snprintf that doesn't
dnl nul-terminate if the buffer isn't large enough.  Others return -1 if the
dnl string doesn't fit into the buffer instead of returning the number of
dnl characters that would have been formatted.  Still others don't support
dnl NULL as the buffer argument (just to get a count of the formatted length).
dnl
dnl Provides RRA_FUNC_SNPRINTF, which adds snprintf.o to LIBOBJS unless a
dnl fully working snprintf is found.

apt install krb5-user sssd ntp
[in tar file] take krb5.conf from centos, but without the includes
    need   default_ccache_name = /tmp/krb5cc_%{uid}
    or OTP won't work
ipa host-add eagle.cs.rutgers.edu
ipa-getkeytab -p host/eagle.cs.rutgers.edu -k eagle
   and install in /etc/krb5.keytab (only root access)
# once firewall updates, kinit without OTP should work
[in tar file, but needs revies] take /etc/sssd/sssd.conf from centos. look at homedir and access check
   in [sssd] section, add "config_file_version = 2"
   change ipa_hostname to local host
   change ldap_dns_service_name to ldap
service sssd start
getent -s sss hedrick
   make sure output is right
make sure /etc/nsswitch.conf lists sss

edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config GSSAPIAuthentication yes; GSSAPICleanupCredentials no

--- nfs

apt-get -y install nfs-common

edit /etc/idmapd.conf, add Domain=cs.rutgers.edu
service idmapd restart

--- rutgers stuff

everything is in tar file, but needs 
* run pam-auth-update to update pam files, enabling RU Kerberos support
* update-rc.d renewd defaults - to activate renewd; service renewd start
[you can skip the rst of this section if you're using the tar file]

apt install libkrb5-dev libkeyutils-dev

make installu14 and the tar file have most of what is needed
but on systems after installing you need to do

pam-auth-update to set up rukerb
update-rc.d renewd defaults

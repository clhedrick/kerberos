This is a wrapper for Freeradius Kerberos authentication. 

The Kerberos module in Freeradius supports only traditional Kerberos
authentication. It doesn't support 2 factor authentication.  That's a
fairly new feature, that makes additions to the Kerberos API.

This generates a shared library. It's used by setting LD_PRELOAD
before running Freeradius. The library traps calls to one Kerberos
library routine, and makes the changes needed to support onetime
passwords.

We recommend using k5start to run Radius, and setting 
LD_PRELOAD=radius-wrap.so

k5start is needed to generate and maintain a Kerberos credential
cache, /tmp/krb_cc_radius. Typically you'd tell k5start to build it
from a keytable. /tmp/krb_cc_radius must be readable by whatever user
radius runs as.

At some point I will modify this code to read the key table itself.
That way you won't need k5start.

.TH PAM_REG_CC 8
.SH NAME
pam_reg_cc \- register credential caches for renewd
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I  pam_reg_cc
checks the current value of KRB5CCNAME in the environment that
PAM is preparing for the user process. If it is defined, 
pam_reg_cc registers it on the session keyring, with the description
krbrenewd:ccname.
.PP
Renewd checks all keys with this description, and renews the
credential caches as needed. 
.PP
Session keyrings are automatically deleted at the end of the session,
so that means that renewd will stop renewing credentials when there
are no more sessions registerd for them.
.PP
It implements only session start (and a no-op session end).

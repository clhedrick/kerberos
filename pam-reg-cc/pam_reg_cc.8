.TH PAM_REG_CC 8
.SH NAME
pam_reg_cc \- register credential caches for renewd
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I  pam_reg_cc [usecollection]
checks the current value of KRB5CCNAME in the environment that
PAM is preparing for the user process. If it is defined, 
pam_reg_cc registers the cache that was just created for
renewd to renew automatically. 
.PP
KRB5CCNAME is sometimes set
to the default collection, rather than to the specific cache.
That can require pam_reg_cc to guess which cache was actually
just created. It will pick a cache from the collection that
has the user's main principal. That's the same cache that sssd
uses, so it should be the right one.
.PP
If usecollection is specified, and the cache is in KEYRING, strips
any subsidiary name. E.g if it is KEYRING:persistent:1003:1003,
although that name will be registered for renewd, the environment
variable will be updated to KEYRING:persistent:1003. This will 
allow kinit, klist, and kdestroy to work as intended with collections.
.PP
In general we recommend setting default_ccache_name in krb5.conf to
KEYRING:persistent:%{uid}, and setting usecollection. 
.PP
When used with NFS, there can be issues if the user kinits as another
principal. Kinit changes the primary cache to the one just set up.
However NFS expects the primary cache to be set to one with the user's
default principal. If someone is working with a different cache (e.g. one
with an administrative credential) this can result in NFS accesses failing,
should NFS choose to recheck credentials at that time.
.PP
For that reason, you may request this module to copy the credential to
a second location. That way changes to the primary cache won't affect
NFS access. There are two reasonable locations: a file in /tmp,
or the file name in gssproxy.conf, usually 
/var/lib/gssproxy/clients/krb5cc_%U. Note that the copy isn't
done for credentials that come from pam_kgetcred. That's because
cron jobs are assumed not to put credentials at risk in the same
way. To make this happen,
configure krb5.conf with credcopy, e.g.
.PP
.nf
[appdefaults]
register-cc = {
    credcopy = /var/lib/gssproxy/clients/krb5cc_%U
}
.fi
.PP
Like gssproxy, this module will replace %U with the user's numeric userid, and %u with the username.
.PP
This module implements only session start (and a no-op session end).
.PP
If this module is being used in a system with renewd, you may want to warn users if the
credentials forwarded to them have too short a lifetime to be renewed. To warn if there
is less than 55 min left use. You may also want to specify ticket_warn_file, which is
a file with the text of the warning message to be printed. There's default text in case
it isn't specified, but this lets you specify your own.
.PP
.nf
[appdefaults]
register-cc = {
    ticket_minlife = 55m
    ticket_warn_file = /etc/krb5.ticketwarning
}
.fi

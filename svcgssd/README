This is a patch to Ubuntu 20's rpc.svcgssd to make group changes show
up. See 
https://linux-nfs.vger.kernel.narkive.com/dgTL2KiI/svcgssd-allow-administrators-to-specify-timeout-for-the-cached-context

For simplicity I'm not doing the UI stuff. I'm hardcoding the timeout to 30 min

as root:

edit /etc/apt/sources.list
uncomment deb-src for at least the main repo

apt-get update

apt-get install build-essential fakeroot dpkg-dev

apt-get build-dep nfs-utils

Following can be done as non-root. It will create a directory quota. You might
want to do it inside another directory, as it will download stuff.

apt-get --build source nfs-utils

this will create a subdirectory nfs-utiles-VERSION. 

Cd into nfs-utils-NNN/utils/gssd

Add the patches. E.g. "patch < diff".

cd ..; make

gssd/svcgssd should be installed as rpc.svcgssd.

This is only needed on servers.

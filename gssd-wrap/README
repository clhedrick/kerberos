This is a wrapper for rpc.gssd.

Normally when a user makes an NFS request, rpc.gssd will do a GSSAPI
call to get a Kerberos credential for the user. They call GSSAPI
asking for the default credential. Suppose you login as hedrick, but
kinit as hedrick.admin. Your default credential is now
hedrick.admin. But that can't work for NFS.

gssd is actually smart enough to realize tht it's not going to work,
and fails. But a better approach is to call GSSAPI requesting the
user's main principal. GSSAPI will then look through your credential
collection trying to find the right principal. So if you have a
collection, e.g. KEYRING:persistent:UID, with both hedrick and
hedrick.admin, it will us hedrick even if hedrick.admin is currently
selected.

This library wraps the call to gss_acquire_cred, and if no specific
credential is requested, it requests the user's primary credential.

It is designed to be used with LD_PRELOAD. We create
/etc/systemd/system/rpc-gssd.service.d/interposer.conf containing

[Service]
Environment=LD_PRELOAD=/usr/libexec/gssd-wrap.so

This module is only useful if /etc/krb5.conf sets up the default
credential as a collection. If you use the traditional
/tmp/krb5cc_UID, this won't work, because kinit as another user
will overwrite your initial credentials. 

The same thing will happen if KRB5CCNAME is set to the specific cache
rather than the collection. sshd likes to do that. We use a pam
library that fixes up KRB5CCNAME. This could also be done via a
script in /etc/profile.d.

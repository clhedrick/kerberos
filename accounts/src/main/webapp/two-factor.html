<h2>Two-factor Authentication</h2>

<p> Our Kerberos implementation supports three forms of two-factor 
authentication: TOTP, HOTP, and Yubikey. In addition, Google authenticator
can be used, as in the past. 

<p> To use two-factor authentication, login to the
<a href="https://krb1.cs.rutgers.edu"> IPA Administrative Application</a>.
Note that once you've enabled two-factor authentication,
if you forget the device it uses, 
you'll need to come in person to get us to disable it.

<p> Clients for TOTP and HOTP are available for IOS and Android. Look for
"FreeOTP" in the appropriate store. The web application will display a QR
code when you scan with the phone application to configure it.

<p> FreeOTP will display a 6-digit code. To login, type your normal password,
adding the 6 digits to the end.

<p> If you're worried about forgetting or losing your phone, one approach is
to add both HOTP and TOTP. Generate several keys using HOTP and keep them in your wallet. Then use
TOTP for normal use. If you lose your phone, you can login with the keys
from your wallet until you can replace it or ask us to remove two-factor
authentication.

<p> To enable Yubikey, you have to use a command-line program,
<blockquote>
ipa otptoken-add-yubikey
</blockquote>

<p> See the <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Linux_Domain_Identity_Authentication_and_Policy_Guide/otp.html"> Redhat one-time password documentation</a> for instructions
on all of these options.

<p> Yubikey will only let you get credentials on a system you are actually
sitting at. If you use it we recommend enabling at least one of HOTP or TOTP.
That will let you work from home.

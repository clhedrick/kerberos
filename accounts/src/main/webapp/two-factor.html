<h2>Two-factor Authentication</h2>

<p> Our Kerberos implementation supports three forms of two-factor 
authentication: TOTP, HOTP, and Yubikey. In addition, Google authenticator
can be used, as in the past. 

<p> There are things to think about before using two-factor authentication.
See the section at the end.

<p> To use two-factor authentication, login to the
<a href="https://krb1.cs.rutgers.edu"> IPA Administrative Application</a>.
Note that once you've enabled two-factor authentication,
if you forget the device it uses, 
you'll need to come in person to get us to disable it.

<p> Clients for TOTP and HOTP are available for IOS and Android. Look for
"FreeOTP" in the appropriate store. The web application will display a QR
code when you scan with the phone application to configure it.

<p> FreeOTP will display a 6-digit code. To login, type your normal password,
adding the 6 digits to the end.

<p> If you're worried about forgetting or losing your phone, one approach is
to add both HOTP and TOTP. Generate several keys using HOTP and keep them in your wallet. Then use
TOTP for normal use. If you lose your phone, you can login with the keys
from your wallet until you can replace it or ask us to remove two-factor
authentication.

<p> To enable Yubikey, you have to use a command-line program,
<blockquote>
ipa otptoken-add-yubikey
</blockquote>

<p> See the <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Linux_Domain_Identity_Authentication_and_Policy_Guide/otp.html"> Redhat one-time password documentation</a> for instructions
on all of these options.

<p> Yubikey will only let you get credentials on a system you are actually
sitting at. If you use it we recommend enabling at least one of HOTP or TOTP.
That will let you work from home.

<h3> Possible problems </h3>

<p> Two-factor authentication is inconsistent with Kerberos key tables and with
cron jobs. By definition, two-factor authentication requires you to use a
second factor to authenticate. There's no way cron can get the second factor.
The same problem exists if you want to be able to start daemons with your
userid automatically when the system restarts.

<p> We have several solutions for people who use two-factor authentication
and also need to use cron:

<ul>
<li> Use <a href="https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~makmur/howto/googleauthenticator/index.whtml">Google authenticator</a>. This is a form of two-factor 
authentication that is checked only for interactive login. It's not
as secure, because if someone is able to become root, and knows your
password, they can access your files. However for many users it 
may be good enough. It works with cron jobs, though you'll still
need to use "kgetcred -r" to register any system where you run
cron jobs.
<li> Use a second user id. E.g. user smith might have a second userid, smith-cron
for cron jobs. That id wouldn't use two-factor authentication. Because it's
a separate user, it wouldn't have any special access to smith's files, and
thus compromises of smith-cron would have no effect on smith's files. If
there are specific files that need to be shared, that can done easily
with group access. To request a second userid, please send email
to help@cs.rutgers.edu. (Alternatively, you could use two-factor
authentication for the second userid and not your primary userid.)
<li> Store all files needed by the cron job on local file systems.
For many systems that's /freespace. Note however that freespace is
not backed up, and is likely to get wiped between semesters.
</ul>

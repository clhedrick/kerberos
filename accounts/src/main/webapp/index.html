<h2> Account Management Tools for<br>Computer Science Systems</h2>

<p><span style="color:#c00"> WARNING: </span> These tools work with a new account management
system. Currently all of the desktops have been moved. As of Friday, Aug 18, the faculty 
and research servers will
move to the new passwords.
<p>
For details on the new system see <a href="kerberos.html">Computer Science Department user administration tools</a>

<ul>
<li> <a href="activate/activate">Activate an account on a Computer Science system</a>
<p>
This will let you create an account for Computer Science Department systems. Computer science
faculty, majors, grad students, and students enrolled in computer science courses other than 110, 170 and 494
are eligible for accounts.
<p>
<li> <a href="changepass/changepass">Set or reset your Computer Science  password</a>. 
<p>
This will show you a University login screen. So as long as you remember
your University password, you set or reset your CS password. If you need more security than a simple password
can afford, please see <a href="two-factor.html"> two factor authentication</a>.
<li> <a href="groups/login">Group management.</a> This will let authorized users (typically faculty) create user groups for computer science systems. This will let you share files with other people and authorize guest users.
<p>
This will show you a Computer Science login screen.
<li>  <a href="two-factor.html"> Two-factor authentication</a>. In case you need more security than a simple password can provide.
</ul>
<div class="textblock" style="margin-top:3em">
<p>NOTE on <b>cron jobs</b>: For systems that use these accounts, 
cron jobs need special attentino. If you're using cron, and you want
your jobs to access files in your home directory, you must use
"kgetcred -r" on each host where you're going to use cron. See "man kgetcred"
for more information.

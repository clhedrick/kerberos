<h1> Account Management Tools for<br>Computer Science Systems</h1>

<p> <b>Note:</b> Your computer science user ID is your <b>University
NetID</b>. You must have a University NetID before you can
activate a computer science account. Here's
the Univeristy's tool for activating your
NetID: <a href="https://netid.rutgers.edu">https://netid.rutgers.edu</a>

<p> Computer science systems use passwords that are separate from 
your University password. You can make them the same, but it is
somewhat better from a security point of view if you use different
passwords.

<ul>
<li> <a href="activate/activate">Activate an account on a Computer Science system</a>
<p>
This will let you create an account for Computer Science Department systems. Computer science
faculty, majors, grad students, and students enrolled in computer science courses other than 110, 170 and 494
are eligible for accounts.
<p>
<li> <a href="changepass/changepass">Set or reset your Computer Science  password</a>. 
<p>
This will show you a University login screen. So as long as you remember
your University password, you set or reset your CS password. If you need more security than a simple password
can afford, please see <a href="two-factor.html"> two factor authentication</a>.
<li> <a href="groups/login">Group and Guest management.</a> This will let authorized users (typically faculty) create user groups for computer science systems. This will let you share files with other people and authorize guest users.
<p>
This will show you a Computer Science login screen.
<li>  Consider giving us contact information, in case we need to reach you for support reasons. 
<p>You can set additional information using "ipa user-mod" on any of our systems, e.g. "ipa user-mod YOURNETID --phone=8484452001". "ipa user-mod --help" will give a list of what can be set. "ipa user-show YOURNETID" will show your current information. You only need to do this once. The same information applies to all of our systems. Note that changing first name, lastname, and GECOS won't do anything useful, since we reset them to the official University names nightly.
<li> By default, everyone uses the bash shell. To change to tcsh use "ipa user-mod YOURNETID --shell=/bin/tcsh" any of our systems.
<p>
<li>  <a href="two-factor.html"> Two-factor authentication</a>. In case you need more security than a simple password can provide.
<p>
<li> <a href="/kerberize.html"> Integrating your computer into Kerberos </a>. How to set up your computer to use Kerberos. (This is for computers located in
computer science department areas. For systems at home, see <a href="https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/resources/working-at-home"> Working at Home</a>.)
<p>
<li> <a href="/sharing.html"> Sharing files between systems</a>
<p>
<li> <a href="kerberos.html"> Technical information on our security and
account setup.
</ul>
<div class="textblock" style="margin-top:3em">
<p>NOTE on <b>cron jobs</b>: For systems that use these accounts, 
cron jobs need special attention. If you're using cron, and you want
your jobs to access files in your home directory, you must use
"kgetcred -r" on each host where you're going to use cron. See "man kgetcred"
for more information.

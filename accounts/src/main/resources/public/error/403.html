You can gotten an "access denied" error. Unless you're poking around
where you shouldn't be, likely causes include

<ul>
<li> Your login session has expired. </li>
<li> There's something wrong with cookie handling in your browser. </li>
</ul>

We suggest going back to the <a href="/accounts/">main page</a> and going
through login again. If that fails, try restarting your browser. If you
get this problem frequently, please report it to help@cs.rutgers.edu with
as many details as possible about what you were doing.

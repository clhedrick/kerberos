 * Don't segfault on corrupt dictionaries.
 * Fixed the data format output by packer to properly pad the end.
 * Add ANSI C prototypes for all functions and mark const variables.
 * Remove unused functions.
 * Various compilation warning and portability fixes.
 * Use Autoconf and portable/system.h to find types of specific lengths.
 * Increase MINLENGTH.
 * Add a check for a duplicated dictionary word.
 * Changed error for very short passwords to match current CrackLib.
 * Remove last block optimization in GetPW and start fresh each time.
 * Close the dictionary after each password lookup.
 * Set hidden visibility on all CrackLib symbols.
 * Close the wfp file handle on PWClose if it's open.
 * Applied various patches from distributions for security vulnerabilities.
 * Changed the type of some variables to size_t to avoid truncation.

# Dummy krb5.conf file for running tests.
#
# We need some krb5.conf file so that the Kerberos library will initialize,
# but we're not going to do any authentication or any Kerberos calls other
# than parsing principals and reporting errors.  This is a minimal krb5.conf
# file that we can use without errors but which avoids any settings that may
# be present in the system krb5.conf that would interfere with testing.

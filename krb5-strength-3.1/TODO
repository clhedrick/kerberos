                         krb5-strength To-Do List

 * Update to CrackLib 2.9, which is currently shipped in Debian.  This
   requires testing to confirm that the on-disk data format is still the
   same.

 * Feed back modifications to CrackLib to allow a program to use a custom
   set of rules, which would allow us to stop embedding our own copy of
   CrackLib customized to add additional rules.

 * Do something useful with errors when parsing numeric arguments from
   krb5.conf configuration or failing to allocate memory when getting
   string arguments.

 * Use the realm of the principal changing its password to determine the
   krb5.conf configuration rather than always using the default realm.

 * Refactor the tests for configuration errors in the heimdal-strength
   test suite into JSON.

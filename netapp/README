This isn't kerberos, but since reviewquota for ZFS is here,
I'm putting the netapp version here.

This requires the Jansson package, https://github.com/akheron/jansson
I did a make install to install the header file and library on the
system.

It's a C library for JSON and REST. It uses libcurl to do the
web stuff.

dhcpd getting data from freeipa

checkdhcp -> /usr/libexec
dhcpd.conf -> /etc/dhcpd.conf or /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
   depending up distribution
serial.conf -> /etc/systemd/system/dhcpd.service.d/

Note that ldap will dynamically read host information from LDAP, but
won't see changes to subnet or other things. For that reason the
web app that manages the data updates a serial number in 
cn=config,ou=dhcp,dc=cs,dc=rutgers,dc=edu
It's stored in the dhcpcomment attribute.

/usr/libexec/checkdhcp is run from cron every few minutes. It will
restart dhcpd if the serial number changes.

SETUP

The LDAP system needs to have the DHCP schema added. This should
be a one-time thing. The schema is in dhcp.ldif. This does not appear
to be an actual ldif file. Maybe you can pass it to ldapadd, but
I think it will need changetype:modify, attributetypes:add, and
objectclasses:add.

dhcpc.ldif sets up the configuration hierarchy, including some sample
subnets. This is obviously Rutgers-specific, but changes shoud be
fairly obvious.

Data is maintained by the ldap web app, which is included in the
accounts subdirectory. It should be possible to use that without the
rest of the Rutgers account management, except that it uses the login
screen from the group management tool, and a few utility classes.
accounts/README says how to deploy this tool, though it assumes you're
going to use all the pieces.

BUG

There's a bug in the code that's critical for us. If there's more
than one host entry with the same Ethernet address, LDAP only
finds the first. dhcp-duplicate-hwaddr.patch fixes it.

This bug should be fixed in anything more recent than Centos 7.

To build dhcpd with this patch on Redhat/Centos, use builddhcp.
It copies dhcp-duplicate-hwaddr.patch into the source area.
You'll have to adjust it to find dhcp-duplicate-hwaddr.patch 
whereever you have it.

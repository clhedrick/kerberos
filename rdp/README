This is intended to be used with Guacamole. It kerberizes the
rdp connection.

When the user logs in, Guacamole gets a kerberos ticket, and
saves is in /var/spool/guacamole/krb5guac_USER_UUID where UUID
is a random UUID. That UUID is saved as the password.

The pam module is added to xrdp_sesman as sufficient. It calls
back rdpserv on the Guacammole server, passing username and UUID.
If it matches a saved ticket, that ticket is sent back, and
the pam module sets it up as the user's Kerberos credentials.

There should be a cron job that kills the tickets in
/var/spool/guacamole after a while, maybe an hour. At that point any
new connections will fail and the user will need to go through a full
login.

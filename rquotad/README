rpcgen -M -N -C -a rquota.x

dnf install libtirpc-devel
also needs zfs development enviornment
  for Ubuntu this is apt install libzfslinux-dev
  for redhat I did it on my build system

edit Makefile. added tirpc and libzfs. removed libnsl, which no
longer exists
  CFLAGS += -g -I /usr/include/tirpc -I /usr/include/libzfs -I /usr/include/libspl
  LDLIBS += -ltirpc -lpthread -lzfs

Mostly this is code from rpcgen.
Lines I added or changed are noted as // Rutgers

Most of this code was generated by rpcgen. I don't thikn it's copyrightable.
However rquota_svc and rquota_server contain Rutgers code. There are a few
lines taken from the normal upstream source for quota, which is under
the GPL. If you're being very careful about licensing, there's a reasonable
chance that that causes this code to be covered by the GPL.

The original contains no copyright notice, so it's unclear to me whether
the GPL restriction is actually enforceable. I am not adding any
restrictions to that.

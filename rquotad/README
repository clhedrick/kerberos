These are patches for Ubuntu's rpc.rquotad. For the moment it
the patched version only works with ZFS file systems.
It only checks quotas on file systems listed in /etc/quotas.conf,
as there's no easy way to ask ZFS whether quotas are on for
a file system.

It's part of the package quota.

edit /etc/apt/sources.list
uncomment deb-src for at least the main repo

apt-get update

apt-get install build-essential fakeroot dpkg-dev

make a directory for the build and cd
apt-get source quota
apt-get build-dep quota

this will create a subdirectory quota-VERSION
cd into that

do the patches. configure has to be done after Makefile.in
is patched

./configure
make

rpcgen -M -N -C -a rquota.x

dnf install libtirpc-devel
also needs zfs development enviornment
  for Ubuntu this is apt install libzfslinux-dev
  for redhat I did it on my build system

edit Makefile. added tirpc and libzfs. removed libnsl, which no
longer exists
  CFLAGS += -g -I /usr/include/tirpc -I /usr/include/libzfs -I /usr/include/libspl
  LDLIBS += -ltirpc -lpthread -lzfs

Mostly this is code from rpcgen.
rquota_server has the actual guts. The rpcgen boilerplate
  is left in place.
rquota_svc just has initialization code added.

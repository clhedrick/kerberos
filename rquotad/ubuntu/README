These are patches for Ubuntu's rpc.rquotad. For the moment it
the patched version only works with ZFS file systems.
It only checks quotas on file systems listed in /etc/quotas.conf,
as there's no easy way to ask ZFS whether quotas are on for
a file system.

This is a quick and dirty hack. It removes the generic Linux
code and replaces it with ZFS-specific code. For setting quotas
it removes everything, since we don't use rquotad to set quotas.
It's like that there will be merge conflicts, but if you realize
all it's doing is removing all the existing code and replacing it
with ZFS, it should be easy enough to fix the patch file. 

It's part of the package quota.

as root:

edit /etc/apt/sources.list
uncomment deb-src for at least the main repo

apt-get update

apt-get install build-essential fakeroot dpkg-dev libzfslinux-dev

apt-get build-dep quota 

Following can be done as non-root. It will create a directory quota. You might
want to do it inside another directory, as it will download stuff.

apt-get --build source quota

this will create a subdirectory quota-VERSION. 

put getzfsinfo.c and diff into the directory

Add the patches. E.g. "patch < diff". You may need to
fix files where patch doesn't do it automatically.

Patch the files and do "./configure; make" in the directory. I've chosen to 
patch Makfile.in rather than the actual makefile, which is why you need
to do configuration again.

The file you want is rpc.rquotad
